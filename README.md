An Analysis of FIFA World Cup Champion's Curse

Author: Yazeed Sobahi

FIFA World Cup is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world. According to FIFA themselves, more than hald the word watched the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. For the 2022 championship, FIFA added more teams to the tournament. It increased the number of teams from 32 to 48. 
In recent World Cup tournaments, viewers and sport media noticed an unusual trend. A trend that would eventually be known as the "Champion's Curse" or "The World Cup Curse".
What is the Champion's Curse?
Since 2002, winners of the tournaments would always be eliminated in the groups stage in the next World Cup. As an example, When France won the 1998 World Cup, they were eliminated in 2002 World Cup before advancing to the knockout stage. Most recent example is Germany, when they won the 2014 World Cup and were eliminated in the groups stage in 2018. This "curse" affected multiple title defenders throughout championships from 1998 to 2018. The only team that broken the curse were Brazil in 2004 after they won the 2002 World Cup. In the next World Cup they performed better than other championship defenders by reaching the knockout stage. (read more) 
The Attack Plan
In this project I attempt to find a logical reason behind this trend. The goal is to compare the efficiency of the affected teams in world cup matches and international matches between each championship. I've decided to include Brazil even though they haven't been "cursed" for the purpose of comparison. Additionally I still want to look into their defeat in the 2004 World Cup even if it's not in group stages.
The theory is that these teams (except maybe for Brazil) did not perform particularly well in their international matches after they won a World Cup championship, and before the next one.
